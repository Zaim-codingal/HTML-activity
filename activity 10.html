                <h1> The Role Of Technology </h1>
                <p>Modern surgeries use advanced tools like lasers, robotic arms,
                and cameras for precision. These innovations make recovery faster and reduce infection risks.</p>

                <h2>Robotic Surgery</h2>
                <p>In robotic-assisted surgery, doctors guide robotic instruments through a console.
                It allows smaller cuts, quicker recovery, and highly precise movements.</p>
